You need to build a web API using .NET 8 that accepts a file containing a Swift MT799 message.

The WebApi service should be able to read the incoming message and store the fields from the message into a database.

Additional parameters:

    Do not use a pre-built library for Swift messages.
    The WebApi should include documentation that allows for testing.
    No Authorization & Authentication required.
    Use SQLite for the database.
    Communication with SQLite should be built without Entity Framework.
    Logging should be implemented using a library (NLog or another).
